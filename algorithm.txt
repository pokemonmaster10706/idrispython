START

1. Initialise Variables:
    f(x) = Function To Be Optimised
    x = Independant Variable

2. Calculate Derivative:
    Derivate f(x) to get f'(x)

3. Find Critical Points:
    Equate f'(x) = 0
    Collect the Values for x that Satisfy the Equation
    These are the Critical Points

4. Calculate Second Derivative:
    Derivate f'(x) to get f''(x)

5. Substitute Values of x:
    Substitute the Values of x that we got in step 3
    if f''(x) < 0:
        Point of local Maxima
    elif f''(x) > 0:
        Point of local Minima
    elif f''(x) = 0:
        Point of Convergence
